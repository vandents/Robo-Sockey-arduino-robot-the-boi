# Robo-Sockey-robot-the-boi

GVSU's Robo Sockey competition, a mix between soccer and hockey, is a semester long competition between all of the students that are enrolled in Introduction to Engineering II. Students were tasked with creating an Arduino robot from scratch that could navigate itself through obstacles without human assistance. Using a 6-foot-by-6-foot arena, teams have three minutes to compete with each other to deliver the most amount of balls into a goal. Teams of 4 were assigned at the beginning of the semester. In total, 40 teams competed in the competition.
